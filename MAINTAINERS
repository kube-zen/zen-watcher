# Zen Watcher Maintainers

This file lists the maintainers of the Zen Watcher project.

## Who We Are

We're a team of **Kubernetes operators** who got tired of reinventing the same event aggregation wheel in every cluster. We built Zen Watcher because we needed it, and we're open sourcing it because we think you might need it too.

**Our philosophy:** This project is built by operators, for operators. We bleed when things break, and we built this so you don't have to.
