# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical and external analysis packages that provide context and reference material for zen-watcher development.

## Purpose

These archives serve as:
- **Historical reference**: Understanding past decisions and analysis
- **Context**: Deep background on design rationale
- **Inspiration**: Ideas and patterns that may still be relevant

## Important: Non-Canonical Status

**⚠️ These documents are NOT the canonical source of truth.**

- **Current direction**: See `docs/PM_AI_ROADMAP.md` for the authoritative roadmap
- **Quality standards**: See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for current quality bar requirements
- **Architecture**: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/INFORMERS_CONVERGENCE_NOTES.md` for current design

Archive documents may be:
- Partially obsolete (referencing old repo structure, deprecated scripts)
- Superseded by newer analysis (e.g., informer convergence notes)
- Historical snapshots (reflecting state at a specific point in time)

## Contents

### EXPERT_PACKAGE/

Expert analysis package containing comprehensive analysis of zen-watcher architecture, performance, and strategic direction.

**Start here**: See `EXPERT_PACKAGE/EXPERT_PACKAGE_SUMMARY.md` for a curated summary and usage guidelines.

## Usage Guidelines

**Use archive docs for:**
- Historical context and rationale
- Understanding past design decisions
- Inspiration for new approaches

**Do NOT use archive docs for:**
- Current task lists or implementation checklists
- Exact performance numbers (may be outdated)
- Replacing current documentation (PM_AI_ROADMAP, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)

## Adding New Archives

When adding new archive content:
1. Create a subdirectory under `docs/archive/`
2. Add a summary document explaining the archive's purpose
3. Update this README with a brief description
4. Link from relevant current docs (PM_AI_ROADMAP, CONTRIBUTING) as "historical reference"
