# Research Plan: Zen-Main Component Reuse Strategy

## Task Complexity Assessment
This is a **complex task** requiring deep analysis of platform architecture components and strategic mapping to webhook solution requirements.

## Research Objectives
1. Map BFF layer for API gateway functionality in webhook platform
2. Identify Brain components for intelligent webhook routing and optimization
3. Catalog integration patterns for webhook provider connections
4. Plan database schema reuse and data model alignment
5. Map monitoring and observability system reuse
6. Design security and compliance framework integration
7. Plan frontend component reuse for webhook management UI

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Component Analysis ✅
- [x] Review zen-main BFF backend architecture
- [x] Analyze zen-brain AI components
- [x] Examine integration patterns
- [x] Study frontend components
- [x] Review platform infrastructure
- [x] Analyze unified webhook architecture

### Phase 2: Strategic Mapping ✅
- [x] Map BFF components to webhook API gateway needs
- [x] Identify Brain components for intelligent routing
- [x] Catalog integration patterns for providers
- [x] Plan database schema alignment
- [x] Map observability systems
- [x] Design security integration
- [x] Plan frontend component reuse

### Phase 3: Recommendation Development ✅
- [x] Develop keep/modify/build recommendations for each component
- [x] Create component dependency mapping
- [x] Plan implementation phases
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Design migration strategies

### Phase 4: Documentation ✅
- [x] Create comprehensive reuse strategy document
- [x] Include visual architecture diagrams
- [x] Provide detailed implementation guidance
- [x] Create component catalog with recommendations

## Success Criteria
- Complete mapping of all zen-main components to webhook needs
- Clear keep/modify/build recommendations for each component
- Actionable implementation plan with dependencies
- Visual architecture diagrams showing integration patterns
